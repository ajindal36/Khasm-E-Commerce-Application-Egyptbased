# KHASM EGYPT SHOPPING APP
This an **android application** made with the help of **ANDROID STUDIO** and **WAMPSERVER** .

## INTRODUCTION

While shopping for something particular, the main question is which shop do we purchase it from? And how do we? It’s simple, we compare the existing shops in the market and choose the best among them keeping in mind - the price, quality & variety of products and offers available. If you are searching for something specific, knowing the shops in which the product is available and at what price basically makes your searching process easier. This is exactly what our application will do! You can also search for the nearest shop and purchase your desired product at a discounted rate showing promotional codes in our application to the shop-keeper. Here is my project, I have chosen this idea of partnering with shops to make the searching process for customers simpler and enabling them to purchase products at discounted rates than usual.  

## METHOD

#### Assumptions made

For the starting phase of this application, It would be about customers creating profiles and searching for products in the 30 shops available in the database. For now, the aim is to cover 30 shops in Alexandria. Later, it will be expanded according to customer response. Also, for now, it’s available only to the citizens of Alexandria, Egypt. 

#### Concepts

Development of this application would require the use of Adobe XD, SQL and Android Studio for front-end and back-end development. But the design team I belonged to needed knowledge in Adobe XD and SQL. 

 

#### Experimental work/data collection 

Building this app requires vast knowledge in the textile industry as the quality and price should be assessed and verified whether it's reasonable before entering these details on the application. If this information isn't practical, customers wouldn't turn up to our application. Also, discount rates must be specified carefully. Knowledge of shops existing in the city - Alexandria, Egypt for this application is also very necessary. The information about the 30 shops i.e picture, location, merchandise and discount they offer was collected. My job was to design interfaces in AdobeXD. Complete data isn’t necessary for creating outlines, just a few details about some of the shops to show how the design would look is more necessary. 

#### Creation of pages in adobe xd

## RESULTS
 The demo of the app is available as screenshots in above **RESULT** file.
